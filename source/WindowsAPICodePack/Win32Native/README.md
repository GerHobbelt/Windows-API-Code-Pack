Usage notes
-----------

This package provides, among others, a catalog of some Windows API. These APIs should not be used directly, the other packages which will come soon already implement these APIs in order to be used with managed code; all the APIs of this package are here only for reimplementation.

In addition to these APIs, this package also provides some managed implementations. These components and all their subcomponents - unless otherwise stated - can obviously be used directly. These components actually are some of the other packages' ones of the WindowsAPICodePack that I moved to this package, because they are required by these APIs.
